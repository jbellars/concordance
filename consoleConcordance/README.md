# Concordance Program

This program will generate a concordance (an alphabetical list of all word occurrences, labeled with the word frequencies and the sentence numbers in which each occurrence appeared) from a file designated in the console by the end user.

This is a console application. You will be prompted for the location of text file from which to create a concordance. The simplest location is likely "C:\Windows\Temp\arbitrary.txt" which is what was originally used for testing.

There are unit tests provided for the major constituent parts of the application.

This program was developed in C# using the fine "Rider" IDE by JetBrains.
